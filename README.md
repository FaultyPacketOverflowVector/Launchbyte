## Requirements

- **For Basic Bypass Functionality:**  
  No additional dependencies are required. You can run the bypasser standalone.

- **For Steam Library Modification:**  
  The Steam library modifier relies on a third-party program called **Steam Tools**.  
  - **Important:** If you only require the bypass features, you do not need to install Steam Tools.  
  - If you choose to use the library modification feature, you must install Steam Tools. The safety and reliability of Steam Tools have not been verified by the Launchbyte team.
